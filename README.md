# GCODE_Plotter_Polargraph
This project allows simulation and control of a simple Arduino based GCODE device, intended to be used for pen plotting. Besides the application exe and code, it includes Arduino code that makes a polar plotter. Roughly inspired by the Polargraph project found at https://github.com/euphy/polargraphcontroller/releases/tag/2017-11-01-20-30.
